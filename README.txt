This mode tunes some parameters the way I like (mostly making some aspects of the game easier or less annoying).

* Removes cargo damage.
* Reduces non-repairable damage taken from collisions.
* Makes normal damage slowly heal with distance.
* Lowers sleep time to 4 hours.
* Removes AI driver's chance to fail to get a job.
